# PTG Home (Drop-in)

This folder contains a **new PTG Home index.html** built to match the PTG “recipe”.

## Folder recipe (matches your mental model)
- **Normal pages (site pages)** live in **root** (like `index.html`, `lounge.html`, `services.html`).
- **Webapps** live in `apps/`.
- Shared assets:
  - CSS: `assets/css/styles.css`
  - Images: `assets/img/...`
  - Music: `assets/audio/music0.mp3` (recommended)

## Music0 setup
Your GitHub repo currently has `music0.mp3` in the root.

You have **two working options**:
1. ✅ Recommended: move it to `assets/audio/music0.mp3`
2. ✅ Keep it in root: leave `music0.mp3` where it is (the home page will auto-fallback)

## Links on the Home page
- `./lounge.html`
- `./services.html`
- `./surveys/`
- `./apps/`
- `./apps/role-quiz/` (add your Role Quiz app folder here)
